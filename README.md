# FaceDetection_OpenCV
> Face detection with OpenCV using Haar Cascades

Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.
### Pre-requisites
Make sure that you have the following packages installed and running before installing OpenCV.
